    "\n",
    "In Chapter 1, we implemented a working 1-D heat equation solver.\n",
    "It runs, but it’s fragile, opaque, and hard to test or extend.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's a common situation in scientific computing:\n",
    "\n",
    " - write some code, see if it runs, fix what breaks, repeat. \n",
    " - It gets results fast, but the code becomes hard to understand, maintain, or extend.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step back: How can we do better?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The key is to *design intentionally*:\n",
    " - by thinking through the structure *before* diving into code.\n",
    "\n",
    "An upfront design exercise is valuable:\n",
    " - it clarifies purpose,\n",
    " - reveals assumptions,\n",
    " - identifies the main abstractions we’ll need.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this isn’t Big Design Up Front. We start with a lightweight design\n",
    "then refine through an iterative process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:**  surface intent early, stay flexible as understanding grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Managing complexity via decomposition**\n",
    "\n",
    "Break the problem into smaller, meaningful pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How?**\n",
    "\n",
    " - Use *abstraction* to identify key concepts.\n",
    " - Use those abstractions to guide decomposition.\n",
    " - Write *specifications* for each piece: clear, testable descriptions of what each piece should do.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The four iterative steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. **Abstraction:** Identify the concepts that matter.\n",
    " 2. **Decomposition:** Organize the code around those abstractions.\n",
    " 3. **Specification:** For each piece, write down what it should do, in a way that’s precise and testable.\n",
    " 4. **Implementation:** Write code that satisfies the specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a cycle, and not a one-time process. As you learn:\n",
    " - Refine your abstractions and decomposition.\n",
    " - Update specifications as understanding deepens.\n",

    "### 1. Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is deciding what matters and what doesn’t. A good software design is based on the right\n",
    "set of abstractions. As such, we start our design and development process by exploring abstractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a creative step, where we explore different ways to represent the system and its components.\n",
    "\n",
    "In scientific computing, this step isn’t given enough attention, but it is crucial:\n",
    "\n",
    "> What matters is the fundamental structure of the design. If you get\n",
    "> it wrong, there is no amount of bug fixing and refactoring that will\n",
    "> produce a reliable, maintainable, and usable system\n",
    "> *- D. Jackson. The essence of software. (2021)*\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**A natural concern:** Aren’t most bugs caused by subtle low-level issues?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, but many “low-level” bugs are symptoms of unclear high-level intent. When top-level responsibilities are muddled, they trickle down into brittle, error-prone implementations.\n",
    "Abstraction pays off by:\n",
    " -  clarifying intent\n",
    " - making low-level details easier to manage.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Procedural, Data, and Functional Abstractions\n",

    " - Procedural abstraction: defining procedures (functions or methods) that encapsulate behavior.\n",
    " - Data abstraction: defining data structures that encapsulate state and behavior (think object-oriented design).\n",
    " - Functional abstraction: using pure functions that operate on immutable data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These forms aren’t mutually exclusive. But in this tutorial, we’ll mostly rely on procedural abstraction,\n",
    "since it’s simpler and fits the style of a small solver like the 1-D heat equation.\n",
    "The reasoning principles apply equally well across all abstraction styles."

    "\n",
    "Once we have modular pieces, we need to say what each one should do.\n",

    "\n",
    "A *specification* is a precise statement of what software should do, independent of how it does it.\n",

    " - **type annotations:** to capture data types and interfaces,\n",
    " - **assertions:** statements about what must hold before, during, or after execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assertions can take many forms: \n",
    " - Function-level contracts (preconditions and postconditions),\n",
    " - Semantic assertions that encode domain knowledge,\n",
    " - Computational properties.\n",
    "\n",
    " Some of these belong inside the code (e.g., preconditions that guard against invalid inputs),\n",
    " while others live *adjacent* to the code, where they can be checked in test suites. Some\n",

    "invariants that must hold during execution, postconditions that check outputs).\n",
    "- **Alongside** the code (e.g., small boolean functions in the same module/class) for local\n",
    "semantic checks.\n",
    "- **In dedicated spec modules** for broader properties that span multiple components, or are\n",
    "common to many components.\n",

    " - to make intent explicit and testable.\n",
    "\n",
    "This flexible approach balances practicality and rigor:\n",
    "\n",
    " - It guides implementation by making expectations explicit.\n",
    " - It supports reasoning and testing by expressing scientific\n",
    "  or computational *facts* as executable checks, placed as close\n",

    "#### Procedures:\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we define the procedures that implement our abstractions.\n",
    "Following the principles of abstraction and decomposition:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Each procedure should have a single, clear purpose.\n",
    " - Procedures should be general: avoid narrowing to specific variables, values, or assumptions.\n",
    " - Each procedure should be as simple as possible, but no simpler.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these principles, we can define the following *general* procedures:\n",
    "\n",
    " - `apply_bc(f_out, bc)`: apply boundary conditions to face fluxes.\n",
    " - `diffusive_flux(f_out, c, kappa, dx)`: compute interior fluxes.\n",
    " - `divergence(c_out, f, dx)`: compute divergence of face quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "** Naming Convention: **\n",
    "For generalizable procedures, we don't want to hard-code specific variable names (e.g., `temperature`, `heat_flux`).\n",
    "Instead, we use:\n",
    "\n",
    " - `f` to denote face fields.\n",
    " - `c` to denote cell fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we use `_out` suffixes to indicate output arguments that will be modified in place, and `_inout` for arguments that are both input and output.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes the procedures general and reusable. If we were to compute the diffusive fluxes of a different quantity (e.g., concentration), we could reuse the same `diffusive_flux` procedure without modification. (This is called *abstraction by parameterization*.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the above general procedures, we need two more, specific to the heat equation solver. For\n",
    "these, the argument names are more specific to clarify their purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `step_heat_eqn(u_inout, kappa, dt, mesh, bc)`: advance one time step.\n",
    "  - `solve_heat_eqn(u0, kappa, dt, nt, dx, bc)`: orchestrate multiple steps.\n",

    " - Clarity: Each function does one thing and does it well.\n",

    " - Testability: Small, side-effect-controlled procedures are easy to test and verify.\n",

    "### Step 3 – Specification\n",
    "\n",
    "Having identified the pieces of our solver, the next step is to make their intent explicit.\n",
    "A specification is a precise statement of what a function or module should accomplish.\n",
    "Not how it does so, but what must hold true if it’s correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall, our practical approach to specification combines:\n",
    " - **type annotations:** to capture data types and interfaces,\n",
    " - **assertions:** statements about what must hold before, during, or after execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assertions can take many forms:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Function-level contracts (preconditions and postconditions),\n",
    " - Semantic assertions that encode mathematical or physical relationships,\n",
    " - Computational properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these checks belong inside the code (for local or safety-critical guarantees),\n",
    "while others live adjacent to it, where they are (re)used in tests and analysis tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Core API and Type Annotations\n",
    "\n",
    "Before writing any code, we begin by specifying a core API:\n",
    "the set of functions that define what the solver does.\n",
    "At this stage, we’re not implementing behavior, but defining interfaces that describe expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This follows the design principle:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Program to an interface, not an implementation. - Gamma et al. Design Patterns (1994)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our functions expose clear, minimal interfaces:\n",
    "they declare what inputs and outputs exist, but hide how results are computed.\n",
    "This separation makes the codebase easier to reason about, relate, and structure."

    "Appendix A traces the roots of our approach in the wider history of software design and development.\n",
    "It highlights related methodologies and advocates, such as Bertrand Meyer’s Design by Contract,\n",
    "Barbara Liskov’s work on abstraction and behavioral subtyping, Daniel Jackson’s model-based design,\n",
    "John Ousterhout’s abstraction-driven philosophy, Edsger Dijkstra’s reasoning about programs,\n",
    "and Niklaus Wirth’s principle of stepwise refinement, all of which shaped the foundations of our approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connection to Test-Driven Development\n",
    "\n",
    "TDD and related test-first methods emphasize writing tests before code. This practice can be\n",
    "powerful for feature-driven projects, but in scientific computing we often don’t yet know what\n",
    "behavior to test. We’re still discovering the right abstractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, we begin with abstraction-driven design: sketching clear concepts and contracts,\n",

    "\n",
    "In other words:\n",
    " - TDD focuses on getting a feature to work.\n",
    " - We focus on discovering the right design for the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "As John Ousterhout argues, good design emerges from reasoning about abstractions. Tests then validate\n",
