    "It works, but it’s fragile, opaque, and difficult to test or extend.\n",
    "In this chapter, we'll take a step back and ask: can we design and reason about our code systematically, before we even run it?\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll introduce preconditions, postconditions, and invariants, which are concepts borrowed from formal logic, and use them to refactor our code step by step into something more modular, testable, and robust.\n",

    "\n",
    " - Identify preconditions, postconditions, and invariants for a scientific computing problem.\n",
    " - Apply backward reasoning and stepwise refinement to improve a messy, monolithic implementation.\n",
    " - Separate concerns in your code: boundary conditions, flux computations, and updates.\n",
    " - Produce a modular version of the heat equation solver that sets the stage for unit and property-based testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    " - Abstraction: Viewing complex systems at a high-level, where irrelevant details are ignored.\n",
    " - Hoare Logic: reasoning about code with `{P} code {Q}` triples.\n",
    " - Backward reasoning: starting from a desired outcome and working backward.\n",
    " - Stepwise refinement: incrementally developing code.\n",
    " - Invariants: conditions that must always hold true during program execution.\n",
    " - Separation of concerns: organizing code into clean, testable components.\n",

    "\n",
    "Abstraction pays off in two ways:\n",

    "- **State Fields**: Represents the temperature distribution and fluxes within the domain.\n",
