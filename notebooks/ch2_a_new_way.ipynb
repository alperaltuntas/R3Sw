    "In Chapter 1, we implemented a working 1-D heat equation solver.\n",
    "It works, but it’s fragile, opaque, and difficult to test or extend.\n",
    "In this chapter, we'll take a step back and ask: can we design and reason about our code systematically, before we even run it?\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll introduce preconditions, postconditions, and invariants, which are concepts borrowed from formal logic, and use them to refactor our code step by step into something more modular, testable, and robust.\n",

    "\n",
    " - Identify preconditions, postconditions, and invariants for a scientific computing problem.\n",
    " - Apply backward reasoning and stepwise refinement to improve a messy, monolithic implementation.\n",
    " - Separate concerns in your code: boundary conditions, flux computations, and updates.\n",
    " - Produce a modular version of the heat equation solver that sets the stage for unit and property-based testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    " - Abstraction: Viewing complex systems at a high-level, where irrelevant details are ignored.\n",
    " - Hoare Logic: reasoning about code with `{P} code {Q}` triples.\n",
    " - Backward reasoning: starting from a desired outcome and working backward.\n",
    " - Stepwise refinement: incrementally developing code.\n",
    " - Invariants: conditions that must always hold true during program execution.\n",
    " - Separation of concerns: organizing code into clean, testable components.\n",

    "\n",
    "Scientific software is both a tool that enables science and a research product in and of itself. As such, it warrants a similar\n",
    "rigor and reasoning as the science it enables. How might we reason about software? Well,\n",
    "we can take inspiration from the scientific method:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Form hypotheses -> attempt refutation → refine toward confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, in the software world:\n",

    "- Specify properties and behaviors -> check -> refine.\n",

    "\n",
    "Reasoning about code requires a level of abstraction that allows us to focus on the high-level behavior of the system without getting bogged down in implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, as scientists and engineers, we are accustomed to this way of thinking: thinking about complex systems at a high level, i.e., by removing irrelevant details, and breaking such systems into smaller, more manageable components. This mindset is crucial for effective reasoning about code.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what happens to the low-level details? Don't the subtle, low-level considerations\n",
    "the most often cause of bugs? While that's true, a focus on high-level abstractions pay\n",
    "off in the form of better isolation of low-level details, overall integrity, and a better\n",
    "understanding. After all, many of the root causes of low-level bugs is due to a lack of understanding\n",
    "and attention to the high-level design and intent, or the trickling down of the bad high-level decisions to the low-level implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstractions are then useful for both reasoning about code and finding the best software design.\n",
    " While the focus of this tutorial is mainly on the former, it goes without saying\n",
    "that both go hand-in-hand, both are crucial for robust software development, and both are non-trivial tasks:\n",

    "## Stepwise Refinement\n",
    "\n",
    "Stepwise refinement is the process of progressively developing a solution, starting\n",
    "from a high-level specification and moving toward a fully implemented system.\n",
    "\n",
    "You begin with abstract definitions, i.e., what the system should do, and gradually\n",
    "refine them into narrow, contract-bearing modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "This naturally produces modular, testable designs, where modularity emerges as\n",
    "a consequence, not as an afterthought.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps of stepwise refinement are:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 0: Identify the What*: \n",
    "Clearly define the overall problem to be solved, focusing on desired outcomes,\n",
    "not how to achieve them.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 1: Decompose into Components*:\n",
    "Break the problem into smaller, manageable parts that represent meaningful abstractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 2: Specify Interfaces and Contracts*:\n",
    "For each component, define interfaces (or external APIs) that capture the behavior in precise, testable terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 3: Implement Incrementally*:\n",
    "Fill in the concrete implementations step by step, ensuring that each one respects or evolves its specification and interface contracts as you learn more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of each refinement step as making the \"what\" more precise, while keeping the \"how\" flexible until you need to commit to an implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "By deferring implementation details, stepwise refinement:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Encourages clean separation of concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Makes invariants and properties local and testable.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Makes systems flexible to change: new implementations can replace old ones without breaking the whole system.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Aligns naturally with API-first approaches, where the external API is treated as a top-level contract to be refined and implemented independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short: start abstract, specify carefully, then refine iteratively. Modularity and robustness emerge by design, not by accident."
