    "## The 1-D Heat Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "We start the way many scientific codes start: get something working.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a 1-D insulated rod (no internal sources/sinks). The temperature u(x,t)\n",
    "evolves by the heat equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\kappa \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\kappa$ is the thermal diffusivity of the material [$m^2/s$].\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discretization (finite-volume flavor)\n",
    "\n",
    " - Split the domain into $N$ cells of width $\\Delta x$.\n",
    " - Let $u_i(t)$ be the average temperature in the i-th cell.\n",
    " - Diffusive flux of $u$ across an interface is (Fourier’s law for this scalar diffusion):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F_{i} = -\\kappa \\frac{u_{i} - u_{i-1}}{\\Delta x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    " - $F_{i}$ is the heat flux at the interface between cells i-1 and i.\n",
    " - Positive $F$ is defined as flowing to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Boundary Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "At the outermost interfaces, we apply Neumann boundary conditions:\n",
    " - Prescribed heat fluxes at the boundaries ($q_L$ and $q_R$).\n",
    " - Setting $q_L$ = $q_R$ = 0.0 models an insulated rod (no heat leaving or entering the domain).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explicit Euler Update\n",
    "\n",
    "A finite-volume update for cell $i$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u_i^{n+1} = u_i^n + \\Delta t \\left( \\frac{F_{i} - F_{i+1}}{\\Delta x} \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    " - $u_i^n$ is the temperature in cell i at time step n,\n",
    " - $\\Delta t$ is the time step size,\n",
    " - $F_{i}$ and $F_{i+1}$ are the heat fluxes at the left and right interfaces of cell i, respectively.\n"
