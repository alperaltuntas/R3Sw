    " - Encode **contracts** (preconditions, postconditions, invariants) as executable checks.\n",

    "With this refined precondition, CrossHair no longer reports any counterexamples.\n",
    "But what about the edge cases we discovered earlier, such as the 7/25 scenario?\n",
    "CrossHair fails to detect these because, as a symbolic execution tool, it reasons primarily over real numbers, not actual floating-point values.\n",
    "\n",
    "This distinction matters. Real arithmetic is exact and free of rounding, while floating-point arithmetic introduces finite precision, rounding errors, and special values like NaN and inf.\n",
    "As a result, subtle bugs that arise from precision loss or rounding behavior, such as the slight inaccuracy of 7/25—can slip past CrossHair’s analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with this limitation, CrossHair remains a powerful tool for uncovering a wide range of other issues: missing or overly weak preconditions, invalid assumptions about inputs, computational bugs, and logical errors in algorithms.\n",
    "These are often the most challenging and costly bugs to identify through traditional testing alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, this limitation can also be seen as an opportunity. By reasoning in terms of real arithmetic, CrossHair allows us to abstract away from low-level floating-point inaccuracies and focus instead on the mathematical and computational correctness of our scientific applications.\n",
    "This higher-level perspective helps us verify the intended behavior of our algorithms and modeling machinery without getting bogged down by the intricacies of floating-point implementation details.\n",

    "Once the core logic is proven sound in this idealized setting, we can then address floating-point concerns separately by using complementary techniques like unit testing or \n",
