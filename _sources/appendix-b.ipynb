    "# Appendix B — Reasoning vs. Test-Driven Development\n",
    "\n",
    "In modern software engineering, Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a popular methodology\n",
    "that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code, verifying behavior through\n",
    "fast feedback loops, and refactoring continuously.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we follow a different approach, which we’ll call Reasoning-First\n",
    "Development (RFD) in this appendix. Instead of starting with tests, we start with\n",
    "abstractions and specifications: Thinking through what the software means before we\n",
    "think about how it will be tested or implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are similarities between RFD and TDD, such as their shared emphasis on programming\n",
    "to interfaces. That is, designing code around stable abstractions that promote modularity,\n",
    "maintainability, and testability. However, there are also important differences in\n",
    "philosophy and workflow, as we’ll explore below.\n"

    "## The Core Idea of TDD:\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Kent Beck's \"Canon TDD\" (2023):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a list of tests you want to cover.\n",
    "2. Turn one item from the list into an actual, concrete test.\n",
    "3. Write or change code to make the test (and all previous tests) pass.\n",
    "4. Refactor.\n",
    "5. Repeat until all tests are implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this cycle, you build up a suite of tests before or while writing\n",
    "the production code. This ensures that\n",
    "\n",
    " - everything that used to work continues to work,\n",
    " - new features are verified as they are added, and\n",
    " - future changes can be made with confidence and ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "At heart, TDD is a workflow for discovering and refining design through tests\n",
    "and sustaining confidence through continuous verification.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Core Idea of RFD:\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach follows a different order of discovery:\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of starting with tests, we start with abstractions and contracts.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Abstraction - Identify essential concepts.\n",
    "2. Specification - Define properties and contracts (preconditions and postconditions).\n",
    "3. Implementation - Write code that satisfies the contracts.\n",
    "4. Verification - Use tests and proofs to confirm that the contracts hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, tests are clients of reasoning artifacts, not the source of them or the drivers of design.\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus is on making design decisions through reasoning about abstractions and properties\n",
    "by making behavior explicitly explainable rather than merely observable.\n",
    "\n",
    "TDD evolves software behavior incrementally through examples and tests.\n",
    "RFD derives code from explicit reasoning built on abstractions and specifications."

    "## Where the two approaches differ most\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design Timing\n",
    "\n",
    "TDD: Design emerges during testing. Developers are warned not to \n",
    "\"think too hard\" about architecture early on.\n",
    "\n",
    "RFD: Design is intentional and explicit from the start.\n",
    "Interfaces and abstractions form the scaffolding for later verification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comment: In research software, where physics, numerics, and performance interact,\n",
    "design cannot be deferred. Intentional abstraction is essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important goal of TDD is to enable and ease refactoring. \n",
    "RFD isn’t against refactoring or evolving abstractions, but it emphasizes getting\n",
    "them roughly right, as best as we can, from the start to minimize costly redesign later.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Code is a poor medium for exploring abstractions. -Daniel Jackson\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specification of Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "TDD: Behavior is defined through examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "RFD: Behavior is defined through properties (such as conservation, symmetry, and telescoping)\n",
    "and contracts (preconditions and postconditions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Comment: Scientific models cannot be exhaustively tested by enumeration.\n",
    "Expressing scientific and computational invariants can provide higher confidence\n",
    "and generality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interface vs Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Both approaches emhasize programming to interfaces, not implementations.\n",
    "But the path differs:\n",
    "\n",
    "TDD: Interfaces emerge from tests and examples.\n",
    "RFD: Interfaces are designed upfront based on abstractions and decomposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feedback and Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "TDD: Encourages rapid development cycles with immediate feedback from tests.\n",
    "This optimizes for developer momentum.\n",
    "\n",
    "RFD: Emphasizes upfront reasoning and design, with tests serving to verify\n",
    "that the reasoning holds in practice. This can lead to longer initial development times\n",
    "compared to TDD.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comment: For scientific software, the cost of a wrong abstraction is far higher\n",
    "than the cost of a slow iteration. Fast feedback is still valuable and encouraged,\n",
    "but not at the expense of conceptual clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"The problem with test-driven development is that it focuses attention on getting\n",
    "specific features working, rather than finding the best design... The units of\n",
    "development should be abstractions, not features.\" - John Ousterhout,\n",
    "*A Philosophy of Software Design* (2022)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Psychological Focus\n",
    "\n",
    "TDD: Focuses on building confidence through passing tests.\n",
    "RFD: Focuses on curiosity-driven exploration to replace uncertainty with understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both methodologies value feedback and learning, but they differ in where understanding originates.\n",
    "\n",
    "## In summary\n",
    "\n",
    "TDD discovers understanding through behavior; RFD builds it through reasoning.\n",
    "In scientific software—where correctness and meaning must be explicit,\n",
    "RFD provides a more natural foundation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "TDD brings discipline and fast feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "RFD extends that discipline upward into the realm of abstraction and specification,\n",
    "turning code into something we can reason about as rigorously as the science it represents.\n",
    "\n",
    "It complements TDD's empirical confidence with conceptual clarity, completing the ladder\n",
    "from testing to reasoning to verification.\n"
