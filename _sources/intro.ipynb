    "The tutorial is structured into several sections, each building on the previous one. Throughout the tutorial, we will work with a sample research software project, which will serve as a practical example to illustrate the concepts and techniques discussed. We will cover topics such as:\n",
    "- Unit testing\n",
    "- Property-based testing\n",
    "- Formal reasoning\n",

    "- Physically-based simulations\n",
    "- Numerical computations\n",
    "- Statistical analysis\n",
    "- AI/ML models\n",

    "## What's Rigor?\n",
    "\n",
    "By rigor, we refer to the degree to which the we can trust the software to perform as expected at all times and under various conditions. Rigor is essential in research software because it ensures that the software is reliable, maintainable, and can be used to produce valid results.  It helps prevent bugs, errors, and unexpected behaviors that could lead to incorrect scientific conclusions or results that are not reproducible or trustworthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rigor is achieved through a combination of practices, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Traditional Testing**: Writing and executing tests with high coverage.\n",
    "    - **Unit Tests**: Testing individual components or functions to ensure they work as expected.\n",
    "    - **Integration Tests**: Testing how different components work together.\n",
    "    - **System Tests**: Testing the entire system to ensure it meets the requirements.\n",
    "    - **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automating the testing process to catch issues early.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Non-Traditional Testing**: Using advanced techniques to improve the rigor of testing.\n",
    "    - **Property-Based Testing**: While there are a variety of approaches, in this tutorial we will focus on property-based testing, which involves defining properties that the software should satisfy and generating random inputs to test those properties. This can help uncover edge cases and unexpected behaviors that traditional testing might miss.\n",
    "to ensure that the software behaves as expected.\n",
    "- **Static Analysis**: Using tools to analyze the code for potential issues without executing it. This can help catch bugs, enforce coding standards, and improve code quality.\n",
    "- **Formal Reasoning**: Using mathematical or logical methods to reason about the software's behavior. This can include formal verification, model checking, and theorem proving to ensure that the software meets its specifications and behaves correctly under all conditions.\n",
    "- **Other Best Practices**: Documenting the software to make it easier to understand, use, and maintain. Using version control to track changes and ensure reproducibility. Conducting code reviews to catch potential issues early. \n"
