    "# Chapter 4: Property-Based Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "In Chapters 1–3, we moved from a quick, monolithic solver to a modular design with unit tests.\n",
    "Unit tests gave us confidence, but only for cases that we handpicked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we’ll take the next step by introducing property-based testing via the Hypothesis\n",
    "library:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Instead of manually writing individual test cases, we’ll state general properties that must be satisfied by the solution such as conservation, symmetry, maximum principle intuition, or linearity.\n",
    " - We will also specify a function that generates valid test inputs. For each input, we assert that these properties hold.\n",
    " - Hypothesis will generate many random inputs automatically, exploring cases we might never think to test.\n",
    " - When a property fails, Hypothesis will shrink the failing case to the simplest possible counterexample, the testing equivalent of a controlled scientific experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a \"property\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "A property is a statement about your program that you expect to hold for all valid inputs.\n",
    "It’s a general rule, not just a single example.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our 1-D heat equation solver, some key properties might include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conservation:** total heat stays constant.\n",
    "- **Telescoping property:** The sum of the divergence over all cells equals the net flux through the boundaries.\n",
    "- **Symmetry:** symmetric initial states stay symmetric under symmetric BCs.\n",
    "- **Monotonicity:** non-decreasing initial states remain non-decreasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unit tests vs. property-based tests:\n",
    " - Unit tests: \"for this input, expect this output\"\n",
    " - Property tests: \"for all inputs satisfying these preconditions, this relation should hold\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Property tests complement unit tests:\n",
    " - Unit tests are concrete and focused.\n",
    " - Property tests are broader and can reveal edge cases you never anticipated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How this relates to Chapter 2\n",
    "\n",
    "In Chapter 2, we introduced preconditions, postconditions, and invariants as lightweight specifications for our solver.\n",
    "\n",
    "Property-based testing is a natural extension of these ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    " - The precondition {P} now defines the input space that Hypothesis will explore.\n",
    " - The postcondition {Q} or invariant becomes the property being checked.\n",
    " - When a test fails, Hypothesis provides a counterexample, helping you determine whether:\n",
    "   - The precondition was too weak (i.e., it allowed invalid inputs).\n",
    "   - The postcondition was too strong (i.e., it ruled out valid outputs).\n",
    "   - There’s a bug in the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of this as turning your Chapter 2 contracts into scientific hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    " - \"If the precondition holds, the property should always be true.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis plays the role of the experimenter, probing your code with many randomized “experiments” to try and refute your claim."

    "2. Strategies\n",
    "    - Use strategies to define the space of possible inputs.\n",
    "    - In our example, we used `st.integers()` to generate random integers for both x and y.\n",
    "    - Hypothesis comes with a number of built-in [strategies](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/strategies.html#). These strategies effectively define how the input space is explored, and how a failing example is shrunk to a \"simpler\" case. Usually you'll compose a number of built-in strategies to generate input data that is appropriate for your problem.\n",

    "## What we just did\n",
    "\n",
    "Property-based testing lets you codify computational, scientific, and mathematical properties as executable claims:\n",
    "\n",
    " - We did prep-work: defined strategies for generating valid inputs.\n",
    " - We encoded properties: telescoping, conservation, symmetry, monotonicity\n",
    " - Hypothesis searched broad input spaces and shrank counterexamples when things went wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    " - This directly operationalizes the scientific method for software: state a hypothesis (property), attempt refutation (generation + shrinking), refine code or specs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some lessons to take away\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Property tests don't replace other testing strategies.\n",
    "2. Property tests pseudo-randomly sample the input search space. This means it is upon you to narrow the search space to “interesting” regions.\n",
    "3. Simple properties are **really** effective.\n",
    "4. Property testing suites are effectively an **empirical specification** of your program’s behaviour.\n",
    "5. Your unit test is most likely a property test in disguise. Generalize them!\n",
    "6. When you find a bug, construct a property test to catch it!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
