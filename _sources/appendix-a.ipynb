    "# Appendix A — Foundations and Influences\n",
    "\n",
    "The design and development approach presented in this tutorial does not emerge in isolation.  \n",
    "It draws on a long lineage of ideas in software design, formal specification, and programming methodology.  \n",
    "Each of these traditions, while distinct in origin, shares a common goal: \n",
    " - to make software behavior **explicit, analyzable, and trustworthy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This appendix summarizes the most relevant intellectual influences and shows how they converge in our approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design by Contract (Bertrand Meyer)\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduced by **Bertrand Meyer** in *Object-Oriented Software Construction* (1997),  \n",
    "**Design by Contract (DbC)** formalized the use of *preconditions*, *postconditions*, and *invariants* as part of an interface.  \n",
    "Each routine carries an explicit “contract” between caller and callee, defining what each promises.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach adopts this idea but generalizes it: contracts are not limited to object methods, they describe  \n",
    "scientific and numerical properties such as *conservation of mass* or *symmetry of solutions*.  \n",
    "Where DbC uses Boolean conditions, our approach often uses approximate or property-based checks  \n",
    "to reflect the realities of floating-point computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Abstraction and Behavioral Subtyping (Barbara Liskov)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Barbara Liskov’s** work on **abstraction** and **representation independence**  \n",
    "(Liskov & Wing, 1994) established that correctness should depend only on  \n",
    "*the specification of an abstraction*, not on its internal representation.  \n",
    "Her principle of **behavioral subtyping** ensures that replacing one implementation with another  \n",
    "preserves observable behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "RFD builds directly on this notion. By defining clear interfaces—such as mesh geometry, flux operators,  \n",
    "and time-stepping routines—we ensure that implementations can evolve (e.g., CPU → GPU)  \n",
    "without changing the scientific meaning of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conceptual Integrity and the Design Process (Fred Brooks)\n",
    "\n",
    "In *The Mythical Man-Month* (1975) and *The Design of Design* (2010), **Fred Brooks** argued that  \n",
    "the essence of software design lies in achieving **conceptual integrity**—a coherent set of ideas that governs a system’s structure and behavior.  \n",
    "He observed that complexity often stems not from implementation detail, but from inconsistent or poorly reasoned design decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Brooks championed **rational design processes**, where alternatives are explicitly evaluated and designs are guided by principle rather than habit.  \n",
    "This outlook resonates strongly with RFD: by reasoning about abstractions and contracts before coding,  \n",
    "we seek conceptual integrity not by accident, but by construction.  \n",
    "Like Brooks, RFD treats software development as a creative yet principled act of design,  \n",
    "where clarity of thought precedes correctness of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structural Reasoning and Model-Based Design (Daniel Jackson)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Daniel Jackson** argues that  \n",
    "*“code is a poor medium for exploring abstractions.”*  \n",
    "He advocates discovering the right abstractions and reasoning about their relationships  \n",
    "*before* implementation.  \n",
    "His **Alloy** modeling language embodies this idea, enabling developers to describe  \n",
    "and automatically analyze system structures and invariants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach shares this design-first mindset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstractions over Features (John Ousterhout)\n",
    "\n",
    "In *A Philosophy of Software Design* (2022), **John Ousterhout** contrasts  \n",
    "*tactical programming*—focused on shipping features—with *strategic programming*—focused on clear abstractions.  \n",
    "He argues that “the units of development should be **abstractions, not features**.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach aligns with this principle.  \n",
    "Instead of feature-driven iteration (e.g., adding a new boundary condition),  \n",
    "we evolve the software around enduring scientific abstractions  \n",
    "(meshes, operators, conservation laws), which in turn simplify testing and reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Weakest Preconditions and Structured Programming (Edsger Dijkstra)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Edsger Dijkstra’s** work on structured programming and **weakest-precondition reasoning**  \n",
    "(1968 – 1976) laid the logical foundation for verifying program correctness.  \n",
    "His famous reminder that “*testing can show the presence of bugs, not their absence*”  \n",
    "underscores the need for formal reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "RFD inherits this spirit by combining executable tests with analytical checks:  \n",
    "unit and property tests demonstrate correctness empirically,  \n",
    "while symbolic reasoning tools (e.g., Z3) can prove it within defined assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Correct-by-Construction and Formal Specification Traditions\n",
    "\n",
    "RFD also echoes ideas from **correct-by-construction** and **formal refinement** frameworks,  \n",
    "though at a m\n",
    "These systems treat development as a sequence of refinements—from mathematical specification  \n",
    "to executable code—each preserving correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "While RFD is far lighter in tooling, it pursues the same integration of reasoning and construction:  \n",
    "tests, properties, and proofs form a continuous spectrum of assurance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Shared Ethos\n",
    "\n",
    "Across these traditions runs a common thread:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Correctness is not something added after the fact through testing,  \n",
    "> but something designed into the system through clear abstraction and specification.*\n",
    "\n",
    "We build on these ideas in a pragmatic way, suitable for scientific research software. \n",
    "We borrow the discipline of **Design by Contract**, the abstraction integrity of **Liskov**,  \n",
    "the structural and behavioral reasoning of **Jackson**, the design philosophy of **Ousterhout**,  \n",
    "and the logical rigor of **Dijkstra**, all while aiming to remain approachable to working scientists.\n",
